# hachimichi
Android app for Hachimichi Internship second round.

The app is built using MVVM architecture with Jetpack Navigation using Kotlin.

The app contains three fragments

 1. It fetches and displays image from firebase database after 5 seconds. 
    I have used coroutine for delaying the request.
 2. It displays available sensors in the device with their information. Clicking on any sensor will display its live data.
 3. It is used for displaying sensor data.
